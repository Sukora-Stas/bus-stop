# Bus_stop application

Bloggersville is served by two bus companies: Posh Bus Company and Grotty Bus Company. Both companies operate a service
from the airport to the central bus stop. The two companies have decided to produce a joint bus timetable. However, bus
travelers find it difficult to use the timetable because of following reasons:

1. It is difficult to search faster buses in the timetable.
2. Some of the buses run faster than others. For a frequent bus traveler it is better to miss an earlier bus in order to
   catch a faster bus which departs later but reaches its destination sooner. 
3. The entries in the timetable are not
   necessarily in order of departure time.

##Instruction:
